âžœ  vhi-support-exam # ssh-keygen 
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key: ./exam_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in ./exam_rsa
Your public key has been saved in ./exam_rsa.pub

Provide generated keypair `exam_rsa` and `exam_rsa.pub` to the student along with the last two paragraphs of this README.

Edit `00_vars_access.tf` to add openstack credentials for the VHI project.
